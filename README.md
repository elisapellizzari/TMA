# Template matching algorithm (TMA) for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) meal detection

This repository contains the implementation of the **Template Matching Algorithm (TMA)**, a method proposed for identifying unreported meals in individuals with **Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)**. The algorithm was developed as part of our research to improve data quality of long-term studies involving this population, with the final aim to develop managing strategies of the disease.
